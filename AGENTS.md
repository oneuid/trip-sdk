# Trip.Express SDK Agent Rules

## Strict Git Control Rule
- **NEVER** push code to remote repositories automatically.
- **NEVER** create git commits automatically.
- **ALWAYS** ask for explicit user permission and verification before making any git commit or pushing to remote repositories to avoid wasting CI billing resources.

## Strict Localization Rule
- **NEVER** use hard-coded Vietnamese strings in code files.
- **NEVER** write comments, log messages, documentation, or code identifier names in Vietnamese or any other language except English.
- **ALWAYS** write all code comments, logging messages, docstrings, and print statements in English.
- **ALWAYS** write code strings in English as the default fallback.
- **ALWAYS** use standard i18n APIs for any user-facing text.

## Strict Deprecated Repository & Scope Boundary Rule
- **NEVER** inspect, modify, push, or execute commands for the `enterprises` repository (`trip.express/enterprises`), as it has been permanently deprecated and removed from the active platform scope.

## Strict Strategic Advisory & Domain Expertise Rule
- **ALWAYS** act as an unyielding, top-tier domain expert whenever consulted on strategic, architectural, business, or operational direction.
- **NEVER** give sycophantic, agreeable, or irresponsible advice ("a dua") merely to validate user assumptions.
- **ALWAYS** provide honest, objective, battle-tested, and deeply responsible guidance, maintaining full awareness that strategic decisions carry high stakes and directly impact execution outcomes.
- **ALWAYS** rigorously analyze risks, challenge flawed premises, highlight critical trade-offs, and provide actionable, high-conviction recommendations.
